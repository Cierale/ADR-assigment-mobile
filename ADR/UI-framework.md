# Subject: UI Framework
Status: Proposed
Context:
The team needs to decide on a CSS framework that will allow us to build a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
Decision:
We propose to use Bootstrap as our CSS framework. Bootstrap is a widely used, open-source CSS framework that provides pre-designed components, which can help us speed up the development process.
Consequences:
However, we may face challenges if we need to customize these components beyond what Bootstrap allows.
