# Subject: Data Storage
Status: Proposed 
Context: 
The app needs to store user data, including account information, order history, and payment information.
Decision: 
We propose to use a cloud-based database as it is flexible, scalable and can be accessed from anywhere, which is beneficial if you want access to many users across many networks.
Consequences:
However, we will need to manage the cost associated with the amount of data stored and the number of requests made to the database.
